# X Education Lead Conversion Prediction

## Problem Statement

X Education, an online education company, is facing challenges with lead conversion. Despite acquiring a significant number of leads daily, the conversion rate is low (~30%). To improve this, X Education seeks to identify 'Hot Leads'—those most likely to convert—by assigning a lead score to each lead. The goal is to increase the conversion rate to around 80%.

## Dataset

The dataset provided includes around 9000 data points with various attributes such as:
- Lead Source
- Total Time Spent on Website
- Total Visits
- Last Activity
- Converted (Target variable: 1 for converted, 0 for not converted)

**Note:** Some categorical variables contain a 'Select' level which is considered as a null value.

## Goals

1. **Logistic Regression Model:**
   - Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100.
   - Higher scores indicate a higher likelihood of conversion.

2. **Handle Future Requirements:**
   - Address additional problems specified by the company and document the solutions.

## Files

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and categorical variables.

2. **Model Building:**
   - Develop a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion.
   - Assign a score between 0 and 100 based on the model's output.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
   - Ensure the model meets the target lead conversion rate of 80%.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Prepare a word document with solutions to additional problems.
   - Create a presentation summarizing the approach and results.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Write a summary report detailing the assignment process and findings.
